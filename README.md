# bg3-text-support
Language support for BG3 text files.

Didnt realise there were a few up on github already for vscode, and in the extension market, but this one is for the one here: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2594?tab=description, and will allow me to add functionality not found in those, like showing handle english text (and potentially in the future, uuids) on hover.

# Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Snippets
- Handles shown on hover (both txt and xml, but xml requires you first open a txt to activate the extension, to be addressed)
# Commands
ctrl+shift+p BG3: Rebuild Handle References
the handle references are generated at activation, so if you add any use this to rebuild
