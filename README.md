# bg3-text-support
Language support for BG3 text files.

Didnt realise there were a few up on github already for vscode, and in the extension market, but this one is for the one here: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2594?tab=description, and will allow me to add functionality not found in those, like showing handle english text (and potentially in the future, uuids) on hover.

this section is WIP
